# Sample

Generate a sample of the standard normal distribution from 12 independent samples of the uniform distribution on [0, 1]



Recall from the Central Limit Theorem that, if ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Xi,i\geqslant%201) are independent identically distributed random variables with finite expected value E[X] and standard deviation ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sigma(X)), then


![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\frac{1}{n}(\sum_{i=1}^{n}Xi)-E[X]}{\frac{\sigma(X)}{\sqrt%20n}}=Z)

where Z is the standard normal distribution and the convergence in the eqution above is in distribution.
